<p></p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p></p>
<p>On this e-commerce, we will be selling a variety of different mountain bikes for very reasonable prices. The target audience really for this website is over 10 years old and onwards as we feel as a company that all mountain bikes is not suitable enough for any people under the age of ten because of a variety of reasons such as they may be too big for them to handle and that could make it slightly dangerous for them to deal with.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the website, we contain pages like this page where we always include a new updates deal at the top along with this introduction, we include an updates page where we will always include any new features and deals for our customers to go and have a look at, we include an individual of mountain bikes that will have a normal deal aside them for our customers to look at, see the details and they can add it to the basket. If you are to purchase our items though, you will have to have an account where you type in your email and password, if you do not have an account, then you can register by typing your first name, last name, you email and password where you then confirm it again afterwards. And the last main page, which can come along with a lot of different pages, is the basket where if you have already ordered a bike, the picture along with the detail, price and a chance to remove. The basket shows all of this along with the price again of everything you have ordered, the shipping price and then the total price of the two.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are then happy with what you have ordered, you can click the button ‘Proceed to Checkout’ which will then bring you to another list of what you have ordered which is a cart along with a number code you have to enter which will be on either your credit card or your debit card, you will have to confirm what payment system you are using to the site in order to complete your purchase. Once you have done with all of this, you can complete your order and we would love it if you were to come back to our site to order again.  We hope you find this site straight forward to navigate around.</p>
